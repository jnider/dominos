I started the JOEL4 kernel from scratch, and then copied over certain files from KOS to
get things going a bit faster.  It now boots!  I can even get to userspace, even though
it doesn't do anything once it gets there.  Now I can concentrate on how to bring up the
rest of the system.  I know the components I need, just have to figure out how to put
them all together.  I want this system to be flexible, so I can boot from a CD or HD or
USB etc. and of course from different file systems.  I know I can replace the media
driver and file system driver to be able to handle every case, so I want to package those
in an initial file like initrd on linux or whatever they are calling it these days.  I
saw they are using the cpio format, which is like tar but simpler.  I think I will use
that as well, since it looks like it answers all of my needs as well.  So the hard part
now is figuring out how to start loading userspace applications.  Assuming I can load
all the modules into memory with the bootloader (which still isn't working by the way)
I have to figure out how to give each one its own memory space.  Obviously I will use
the kernel API's for that, but who is going to call them?  I need some kind of loader.
And I have been down this road before with KOS, and got a bit stuck with mapping page
tables automatically for new tasks.  I hope it will go smoother this time.
On the positive side, I borrowed the serial port driver from syslinux, and it worked
almost immediately.  I had to make one small change to the order of the outb()
parameters, and then it just worked.  So I now have a decent level of visibility into
my kernel, and I'm ready to start implementing some higher functionality.

Tried to use the sel4 kernel from OK labs to save time.  It doesn't boot right, so I
have to find another solution.  I found one of my old KOS kernels, and it booted right
away using the same boot loader (SYSLINUX+mboot.c32) so I know my script, image, method
etc are correct.  I then tried Fiasco.OC and was able to boot that one too, so there is
definately a problem with the sel4 build I'm using.  Anyway, we're almost set up to be
able to use 3 different kernels interchangably.

One more problem.  I found out that if I perform the above steps, the kernel does not
automatically recognize the partitions and create /dev/loop0p1 for me.  I also found
out several kernel patches have been proposed, and none have yet been accepted for
some reason.  At least partx does the job, and has been added to the script.  And
now Virtualbox is up to 4.1.22, and we're running on Windows 7.

I tried a million ways to use parted, fdisk, cfdisk, sfdisk to make a simple boot disk.
These tools have frustrated me to no end, and still I did not succeed.  In the end, the
solution was simple: use the gnome tool "disk utility" to partition the disk as I wanted,
and then copy the mbr to a 512-byte binary file.  Now each time I wish to reproduce the
image, I create the empty file, use the loop dev to make it into a disk, and use dd to copy
the prepared mbr into it.  Now it is just a matter of using "mkdosfs" to format the
partition, then using syslinux to put a boot loader on it.  Now it is all wrapped up in a
convenient script 'makeimage.sh' which performs all of these steps, and additionally puts
the kernel, and creates an iso image ready for booting from a CD.
