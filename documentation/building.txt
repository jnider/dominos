How to build the kernel
-----------------------
The kernel is a regular ELF file.


How to build the initial ramdisk
--------------------------------
The initial ramdisk is a CPIO archive. It is created like this:
	cpio --format=newc -o < initfiles.txt > init.cpio

It reads the file "initfiles.txt" which is a simple text file specifying which files to
include in the archive. This is a very simple setup. The output directory structure matches
the input directory structure, and there is currently no way to change that. There may come
a time in the future that this will change.
