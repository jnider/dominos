Somehow, the kernel and initrd get loaded into memory. There are many methods to do this,
such as a bootloader (grub), netboot (pxe) or directly by QEMU. It doesn't matter.

The kernel is a regular ELF file, which is multiboot compliant.

The initial ramdisk is a CPIO archive.

Everything starts from boot.s, which contains the multiboot header and tries to get into
a high-level language as quickly as possible.
