Messages should be sent asynchronously from the system to applications to
notify them of various changes. These messages should be unsolicited (sent
automatically from the server to the clients without being requested
individually). There should be a mechanism to filter which messages are able
to be received, and a maximum freqency.

Messages should be received on a message channel associated with the process.
This is similar to Windows messages, but without the need for polling and
getting the message - it will be pushed to an asychronous handler function
which will be called with a pointer to an array of received messages. This
is also similar to a UNIX signal, but with the ability to batch multiple
messages, and have a more generic message namespace with types that can be
declared by the user.
