I tried a million ways to use parted, fdisk, cfdisk, sfdisk to make a simple boot disk.
These tools have frustrated me to no end, and still I did not succeed.  In the end, the
solution was simple: use the gnome tool "disk utility" to partition the disk as I wanted,
and then copy the mbr to a 512-byte binary file.  Now each time I wish to reproduce the
image, I create the empty file, use the loop dev to make it into a disk, and use dd to copy
the prepared mbr into it.  Now it is just a matter of using "mkdosfs" to format the
partition, then using syslinux to put a boot loader on it.  Now it is all wrapped up in a
convenient script 'makeimage.sh' which performs all of these steps, and additionally puts
the kernel, and creates an iso image ready for booting from a CD.

One more problem.  I found out that if I perform the above steps, the kernel does not
automatically recognize the partitions and create /dev/loop0p1 for me.  I also found
out several kernel patches have been proposed, and none have yet been accepted for
some reason.  At least partx does the job, and has been added to the script.  And
now Virtualbox is up to 4.1.22, and we're running on Windows 7.

Tried to use the sel4 kernel from OK labs to save time.  It doesn't boot right, so I
have to find another solution.  I found one of my old KOS kernels, and it booted right
away using the same boot loader (SYSLINUX+mboot.c32) so I know my script, image, method
etc are correct.  I then tried Fiasco.OC and was able to boot that one too, so there is
definately a problem with the sel4 build I'm using.  Anyway, we're almost set up to be
able to use 3 different kernels interchangably.
